Homework 05

### What is TensorFlow? Which company is the leading contributor to TensorFlow?


### What is TensorRT? How is it different from TensorFlow?

### What is ImageNet? How many images does it contain? How many classes?

### Please research and explain the differences between MobileNet and GoogleNet (Inception) architectures.

### In your own words, what is a bottleneck?

### How is a bottleneck different from the concept of layer freezing?

### In part one this lab, you trained the last layer (all the previous layers retain their already-trained state). Explain how the lab used the previous layers (where did they come from? how were they used in the process?)

### Why is the batch size important? What happens if you try running with a batch size of 32? What about a batch size of 4?

### Find another image classification feature vector from tfhub.dev and rerun the notebook. Which one did you pick and what changes, if any did you need to make?

### How long did the training take in part 2?

### In part 2, you can also specifiy the learning rate using the flag --learning_rate. How does a low --learning_rate (part 2, step 4) value (like 0.001) affect the precision? How much longer does training take?

### How about a --learning_rate (part 2, step 4) of 1.0? Is the precision still good enough?

### For part 2, step 5, How accurate was your model? Were you able to train it using a few images, or did you need a lot?
